# Remote driver indices

The remote drivers (RD) from Zappa & Shepherd are evaluated based on an ensemble of CMIP6 models. 

The ESMValTool recipes are written in such a way that more models or ensemble members can be added to the evaluation easily.

The bounds of the model distribution are set as low and high limits representing the 80% of the distirbution. Models with lower or higher values with respect to these limits can be interpreted as low/high RD models.
